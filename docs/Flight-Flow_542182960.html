This cron job will fetch all the records from this temporary table and pass to the third party API (which is order view) one by one to get the generated PNR and once got the PNR for the passed booking then this record get deleted from temporary table and system will update the response in main table. </em><br/><em>But need to manage one thing for this cron job is if one cron job is running then next time after 30 second the second cron job should not get called till it completes the first process.</em></p></li></ol></li><li><p>Success page:</p><ol><li><p>After successful booking, the system will redirect users to this page.
