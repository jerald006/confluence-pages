Instead of having a dependency on the environment config, we can easily change where a configuration value is being read from.</p></li><li><p>The code becomes decoupled from system configuration. Also, we can identify issues even before the application starts allowing us to have a proper setup.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-CreateCustomerrors"><strong>Create Custom errors</strong></h3><p>Instead of throwing messages, throwing custom errors help debugging the code faster.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.1">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>This will save tons of time finding what is causing the error as it gives more information when an error occurs.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-ExtractDBQueries"><strong>Extract DB Queries</strong></h3><p>Move all database operations to a separate folder and use those when needed.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.2">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>Database operations are happening randomly at whatever place database operations are being done. This couples the code with tightly with database operations. If there is a change in the databsae structure, then each and every place has to be changed to suit that change.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-FixRoutestructure"><strong>Fix Route structure</strong></h3><p>The routes used in the application are not well reflected by the folder structure. The current structure does not help in finding the route easily as it is segregated based on versions. Instead, the versioning should happen inside the corresponding route.</p><p>The structure should be based on various entities of the domain rather than versions.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.3">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>There is no easy way to figure out if a particular operation resides in v1 or v2 or v3. One has to manually go through each of the version files to find an endopint.</p></li><li><p>Instead, if versions resided inside a single file, it will make it easier to debug and version control as well.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Place3rdpartyservicesinonefolder"><strong>Place 3rd party services in one folder</strong></h3><p>All the 3rd party services should be placed in their own folder where they have all the operations related to it inside. Currently, the services are scattered all over the place with their operations being defined in random places.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.4">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>When 3rd party services are placed in its own folder, we can easily understand the interfaces that are available to us. This allows us to decouple the code as well as replace or add new services providing similar functionality independent of other code. Also, it becomes easier to change the services without affecting the code.</p></li><li><p>If a 3rd party service provider changes their response data, the current architecture will break causing the entire application to crash.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Putresponsemessagesinasinglefile"><strong>Put response messages in a single file</strong></h3><p>Currently, the messages that are being returned to the user are written in the same place as where the operation occurs. This does not allow us to quickly change a message text if needed.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.5">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>Helps in internationalization as all messages will be in a single place instead of all over the place. We can simply pass all the messages for allowing globalization of messages being sent to the user.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Change.thentoasync/await"><strong>Change .then to async/await</strong></h3><p>Debugging and changing logic of an application becomes very hard. Since .then results in lots of nesting and unnecessary complexity.</p><p>It can easily be replaced by async/await</p><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-GlobalResponseHandler"><strong>Global Response Handler</strong></h3><p>The responses that are being sent to the user are controlled by the operation that is handling the application flow.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.6">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>We do not have control over the response that is being sent from the application. A central controller should handle all the responses and make sure that there is a structure to it.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Documentthedatabasemodels"><strong>Document the database models</strong></h3><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-SeparateBusinesslogicfromcontroller"><strong>Separate Business logic from controller</strong></h3><p>All of the business logic and server logic is written in the same place. They should be separated into their own areas.</p><h4 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.7">Reason</h4><ul><li><p>The business logic and the application logic should be separate. Coupling the two makes it extremely difficult to have a stable application.</p></li></ul><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-RemovemultipleCRONsforBitPay"><strong>Remove multiple CRONs for BitPay</strong></h3><p>Have a single CRON instead of multiple ones for bookings</p><h2 id="XeniCleanupPlan-CreatingaPaymentSystem"><strong>Creating a Payment System</strong></h2><p>Separate payments into its own service to manage payments.</p><h3 id="XeniCleanupPlan-Reason.8"><strong>Reason</strong></h3><p>There was a problem with BitPay because of tight coupling in the code. Adding new concepts was really hard as the previous code didn't allow changing the flow. Data was flowing without a structure between various operations.</p><p>Payments is the key and the most sensitive operation in the system, but there are no fail safes in the system. Payment mechanisms should ideally be separated into their own operation instead of making it a part of the business logic.</p><p>There are many unanswered questions such as - What happens if a booking is made, but the payment did not go through? What happens if payment takes a while to be processed, but the booking is confirmed? If a booking is confirmed, payment made, but the booking isn't stored in XeniPay, what needs to be done?</p><p>All of these unhandled cases will cause lots of bugs and issues which could not be manually handled once the system reaches a lot of users. This will also stop Xeni from being stable.</p>
