It will also help the admin to ensure that the feature is being used correctly and in accordance with any policies or guidelines that have been set for its use.</p><p>In addition to viewing the transactional history, the admin may also have the ability to export the data for further analysis or reporting. This could be useful for tracking the performance of the credit feature over time and identifying opportunities for improvement.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong><u>User Stories</u></strong></p><p><strong>Super Admin:</strong></p><ul><li><p>As a super admin, I want to be able to view the points balances of all agencies so that I can ensure that the credit feature is being used fairly and appropriately.</p></li><li><p>As a super admin, I want to be able to add or remove points from an agency's balance so that I can make adjustments as needed in response to changes in the business or market.</p></li><li><p>As a super admin, I want to be able to set limits on the number of points that an agency can redeem in a given period so that I can control the usage of the credit feature and prevent abuse.</p></li><li><p>As a super admin, I want to be able to view the transactional history of the credit feature for each agency so that I can track the usage of the feature and identify any trends or patterns.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Agency Owner:</strong></p><ul><li><p>As an agency owner, I want to be able to view my available points balance so that I can plan my point usage and make informed decisions about when to redeem points.</p></li><li><p>As an agency owner, I want to be able to redeem points for bookings so that I can make bookings without having to pay upfront with cash or credit.</p></li><li><p>As an agency owner, I want to be able to track my point usage so that I can budget my points effectively and make the most of my available balance.</p></li><li><p>As an agency owner, I want to be able to use points in conjunction with other forms of payment so that I have flexibility in how I pay for bookings.</p></li><li><p>As an agency owner, I want to be able to distribute points to my sales agents so that they can use them to make bookings on behalf of our customers.

These rules could be based on factors such as the type of booking, the value of the booking, or the agency's overall performance.</p><p>For example, the super admin might set up a rule that awards 50 points to an agency for every flight booking made using credit, and another rule that awards 100 points to an agency for every hotel booking made using crypto. The super admin could also set up rules that award bonus points to high-performing agencies or that incentivize agencies to use credit or crypto more frequently. Every point can translate to a dollar value which can be decided.</p><p>To implement this feature extension, the system will need to track the payment methods used for each booking and automatically apply the appropriate points rules. The system will also need to update the points balances of the relevant agencies in real-time as bookings are made.</p><p>This feature extension will provide the super admin with more control over the points program and will allow them to use points as a way to incentivize and reward agency performance. It will also provide agencies with an additional way to earn points and will encourage them to use credit and crypto as payment methods for bookings.</p><p />
