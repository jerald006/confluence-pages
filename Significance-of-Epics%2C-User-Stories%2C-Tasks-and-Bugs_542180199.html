                    <h2 id="SignificanceofEpics,UserStories,TasksandBugs-Epic"><strong><u>Epic</u></strong></h2><p>It is useful as placeholder for large requirements. It probably won’t fit into a sprint and should be broken down into stories. Epics are usually defined during the initial product roadmap and decomposed into stories in the product backlog as more is learned and is usually written in the format of User Stories. The decomposed stories in an epic have a common objective and a specific outcome or high-level user need or part of the journey or process someone takes in using the service.</p><h2 id="SignificanceofEpics,UserStories,TasksandBugs-Story"><strong><u>Story</u></strong></h2><p>It is the smallest unit of user functionality in agile which can be delivered in one agile sprint.  It is typically estimated using story points and defined using INVEST criteria. User stories should deliver a vertical slice of functionality to the customer that is valuable and complete by the end of an iteration. A user story must deliver particular value to the user and must be describable in simple language that outlines the desired outcome. </p><h2 id="SignificanceofEpics,UserStories,TasksandBugs-Task"><strong><u>Task</u></strong></h2><p>Tasks are decomposed parts of a story that get into HOW the story will be completed. Tasks can be hour estimated if desired. Tasks are usually defined by the people doing the work (developers, QA, etc), whereas stories and epics are generally created by the customer or the product owner on behalf of the customer. Thus, the tasks no longer need to be understandable by business users and so can be highly technical. The process of breaking a story down into tasks also helps the development team better understand what needs to be done.</p><h2 id="SignificanceofEpics,UserStories,TasksandBugs-Bug"><strong><u>Bug</u></strong></h2><p>A problem that impairs or prevents the functions of the product. Bugs can be identified during the sprint cycle or after release to production. If it occurs during the sprint, its called a Sprint bug. If it is identified after rolled out to production, its a called a Prod bug and becomes a high priority issue.</p>
